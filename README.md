EAT DA BURGER


In this application, we combine front end and back end languages to create a basic website that's connected to a database that 
stores burgers. Eating a burger changes its status and moves it out of the "Un-eaten" list. If you want to eat it again simply click 
on the "Delicious" button to move it back to "Un-eaten". You can also delete the burger from the list, doing so also removes it from the 
database.
